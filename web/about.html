			<h1> About this page</h1>
			<p>This page exists to try to hook people up with soccer teams in their area.</p>
			<h4>Why?</h4>
			<p>Because, right now, basically any American or Canadian soccer player over the age of 12 has 5 years to prove they have what it takes to qualify their country for the Qatar World Cup in 2022. To do that, people need to go play, go to games, watch game, talk about the sport. And, to do that, folks gotta know who is their neighborhood team.</p>
			<p>Do you know who the PDL team in your neighborhood is? When the next home game for your local USL club is? If not, This page is designed to let you figure out the basics of where and when something is happening.</p>
