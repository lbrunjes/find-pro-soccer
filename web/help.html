		<h1> How to help out</h1>
		<p>This page exists to try to hook people up with soccer teams in their area. Basically, the biggest thing is making sure data is getting propperly published.</p>
		<p>If you see problems report them, you can use github, email, or just yell really loud.</p>
		<p>If you want to volunteer submit some pull requests or issues on github and we can get some things worked out.</p>
