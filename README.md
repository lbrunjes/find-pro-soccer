# Soccer In America
A simple zip/postal code/ Map click lookup for USA and Canadian soccer teams

## TODO
* maybe setup database?
* find schedule of game data for 2018

* support National Teams and competitions (?)
* remove outlines on NYRB2 (HAHA NO)

* support recent form (access to games api)
* Proper team colors
* Better data entry instead of piles and piles of JSON
